# Lego Vincent Van Gogh Starry Night

Simple python program to replace the pixels of an image with the closest matching colour listed in the "colourList" file
Pixelation is done by resizing the image using a image editor, I used Paint.NET

Format of "colourList" is, ROW 1,2,3 = R,G,B value and are copied straight from "Lego Colours" file

Different images can be obtained by reducing colours from the list or changing the brightness, contrast, etc. before recolouring
